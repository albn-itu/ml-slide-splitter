# ML PDF splitter
This is a very simple python script to split the slide PDF files given in the Machine Learning course, that for some unknown reason has 2 slides per page. This crops them perfectly and places them on a page each.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python split.py <input_file> <output_file>`
4. Enjoy your slides!
